.container .level p:hover{
    background-color: var(--Light-Grey);
    color: var(--White);
}
.container .level p:active{
    background-color: var(--Orange);
}
```
```js
function Submit(){
    event.preventDefault();
    let y = document.getElementById("rating")
    y.style.display = "none"
    let x = document.getElementById("result")
    x.style.display = "block"
}
```
